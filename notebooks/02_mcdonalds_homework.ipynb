    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, your first sub-task is to **calculate the mean confidence score for each row**, and then store those mean scores in a new column. For example, the confidence scores for the first row are `1.0\\r\\n0.6667\\r\\n0.6667`, so you should calculate a mean of `0.7778`. Here are the suggested steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the [`Series.str.split()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.split.html) method, convert the **policies_violated:confidence** column into lists of one or more \"confidence scores\". Save the results as a new DataFrame column called **confidence_list**.\n",
    "2. Define a function that calculates the mean of a list of numbers, and pass that function to the [`Series.apply()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.apply.html) method of the **confidence_list** column. That will calculate the mean confidence score for each row. Save those scores in a new DataFrame column called **confidence_mean**.\n",

    "Your second sub-task is to **remove lower-quality rows from the training set**, and then repeat the model building and evaluation process. Here are the suggested steps:\n",

    "1. Remove all rows from X_train and y_train that have a **confidence_mean lower than 0.75**. Check their shapes before and after to confirm that you removed about 300 rows.\n",
