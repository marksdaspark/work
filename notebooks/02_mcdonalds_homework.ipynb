    "McDonald's receives **thousands of customer comments** on their website per day, and many of them are negative. Their corporate employees don't have time to read every single comment, but they do want to read a subset of comments that they are most interested in. In particular, the media has recently portrayed their employees as being rude, and so they want to review comments about **rude service**.\n",

    "McDonald's has hired you to develop a system that ranks each comment by the **likelihood that it is referring to rude service**. They will use your system to build a \"rudeness dashboard\" for their corporate employees, so that employees can spend a few minutes each day examining the **most relevant recent comments**.\n",
